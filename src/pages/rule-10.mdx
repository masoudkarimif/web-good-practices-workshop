# 10. Consider using TypeScript, especially when you're working in a big group!

> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which means that the types are checked, and datatype errors are spotted only at the runtime.

> TypeScript introduces optional strong static typing: Once declared, a variable doesnâ€™t change its type and can take only certain values. The compiler alerts developers to type-related mistakes, so they have no opportunity to hit the production phase. This results in less error-prone code and better performance during execution.

### You can start a React project with TypeScript using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

### Example:

```jsx
import React from "react"

interface Props {
  name: string;
  color: string;
}

type OtherProps = {
  name: string,
  color: string,
}

// Notice here we're using the function declaration with the interface Props
function Heading({ name, color }: Props): React.ReactNode {
  return <h1>My Website Heading</h1>
}

// Notice here we're using the function expression with the type OtherProps
const OtherHeading: React.FC<OtherProps> = ({ name, color }) => (
  <h1>My Website Heading</h1>
)
```
